 Python Discord Bot Code



Description:
This repository contains the code for a Python Discord bot that utilizes OpenAI's language model to generate responses. The bot listens for messages, and when mentioned, it uses the OpenAI API to generate a response based on the content of the message. The generated response is then sent back to the channel where the message was received.

Key Files:
- bot.py: Contains the main code for the Discord bot.
- .env: Contains the required API keys and tokens.

Instructions:
1. Make sure you have a valid OpenAI API key and a Discord bot token.
2. Set the OpenAI API key and Discord bot token in the .env file.
3. Run the bot.py script to start the Discord bot.
4. The bot will be active and ready to respond to messages when mentioned.

Dependencies:
- discord.py: Python library for interacting with the Discord API.
- openai: Python library for using the OpenAI GPT-3 language model.

Notes:
- The bot uses the 'text-davinci-003' model from OpenAI.
- The 'message_content' intent is required for the bot to receive messages.
- Ensure that the bot has the necessary permissions to read and send messages in the desired Discord server.
